# Haskell Utils

This is a package I made for myself with some utility functions inside of it that can just make my life easier will programming in Haskell.

This will be updated as it's made.

## Personal Rules

1. Always write tests for these functions since they'll be used in other projects.
2. Put things in the correct spaces
3. If it's a general utility put it under Utility. If it's for strings use Utils.Strings
